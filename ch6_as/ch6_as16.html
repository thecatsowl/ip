	Assignment:	Chapter 6 - Assignment 16 

	Filename:	ch6_16as.html

	Purpose:	This document contains a script in the head file. The body element remains empty.
				When the document loads into a browser, the JavaScript file in the head element
				runs; this script prompts the user for two integer numbers, and the output 
				displays the sum, product, difference and quotient of the two numbers.
				The "window" Object's "prompt" method is used.
				
	Notes:		The Object resides in memory its information is used by the script; attributes are
				the its data and its behavior is its methods. The Object's methods use the attributes
				to perform useful actions for the client of the Object, which is the script that calls
				the methods.

				The "\n" escape sequence only works within the dialogue box in this script.
				In order to render a new line, the "<br>" tag must be used within the quoation marks
				of a concatenated string.

				The "window" Object's "prompt" method displays in the script-generated dialogue box, so
				the "\n" escape sequence is used for a new line.

				The "document" Object's "writeln" method renders within the document, so "<br>" tags
			    are used for a new line.

   	  The textbook uses an empty body element, but in order to experiment with results, I used header and 
	  nav elements. The script's "document" Object's "writeln" method rendered the text above the header
	  and nav elements, which was interesting.
