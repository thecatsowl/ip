		<b>1.17 (Watch as an <span class="keyword">Object</span>) 
			You're probably wearing on your wrist one of the world's most common types of <span class="keyword">objects</span> &mdash; a watch. 
			Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: 
			<span class="keyword">object</span>, <span class="keyword">attributes</span>, 
			<span class="keyword">behaviors</span>, <span class="keyword">class</span>, 
			<span class="keyword">inheritance</span> (consider, for example, an alarm clock), 
			<span class="keyword">abstraction</span>, <span class="keyword">encapsulation</span>, 
			<span class="keyword">interface</span> and <span class="keyword">information hiding</span>.
		</b>
	</h3>
	<ol class="answer">
		<li>
			When a watch is built, it becomes an Object I can purchase or receive.	
		</li>
		<li>
		If my particular watch is custom built according to my preferences, I may choose to make it gunmetal blue, with turquoise zeros and ones, and have my name engraved: 
		these would be my watch's particular Attributes; in this instance, its colors and custom engraving would be its particular Attributes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In order for my watch to behave like a watch, it must be able to tell time; this will be performed by a method, housed in the design of my watch, that instructs
			my watch to produce a measure of time, either digitally or mechanically: these methods are manifested as the "Behavior" of my watch.
		</li>
		<li>
			Before someone can build my watch, they must have its design; the engineering design of my watch is analogous to it Class in programming. 	
		</li>
		<li>
			If someone were to make my watch hi-tech and allow it to connect to Wi-Fi, have bluetooth and play audio and vidoe, it would have to inherit its original 
			features into a class with its upgraded features: this would be Inheritance.
		</li>
		<li>
			If I don't know anything about physics, engineering, design, or mechanics, I should still be able to use my watch: Abstraction means that I can use my 
			watch without knowing how it works "under the hood."
		</li>
		<li>
			Encapsulation is the same idea: a class ( in this case, the design of my watch) encapsulates the methods (the "behavior" of my watch) and the attributes
		 	(colors, engravings, etc.) of my watch; other watches don't have to be like mine; the encapsulation of my class of watch makes it unique.
		</li>
		<li>
			Interface is also related to Abstraction and Encapsulation, in that what I interact with is a surface that simplifies the complexity underneath; I don't need
			to know all the chips, gears, mechanics and physics beneath that surface; that surface simply has to make it easy for me to interface with me, the user of 
			the watch.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally, Information Hiding is also connected to the concepts of Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Interface: the implementation details of the design 
			process are hidden from me, the user of the watch; the more information of the design of my watch is hidden from me, the better the Abstraction, the 
			Encapsulation, and the Interface; indeed, the overall engineering of my watch is improved with good Information Hiding, just as the overall engineering
			of software is improeved with proper Information Hiding.
